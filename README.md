### This Project will predict scores based on Student's Hours of study 

![Linear Regression](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/linear-regression-python-scikit-learn-1.png)


This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
